This plugin uses new [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and [Cache API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) to allow your users to access the contents of your site while they are offline or under unreliable network situations by caching part of your site.

Once you've installed this plugin, anyone visiting your site in [browsers that support the Service Workers API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers) will be able of access your content even if they run out of network or experiment network instability.

Configure the plugin in the left "Offline" submenu of your WordPress dashboard.

2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress Dashboard.

Alternatively,

1. Clone or download the project repository
2. Copy `wp-offline-content` directory inside your WordPress installation plugins directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What browsers support the W3C Service Workers API? =
[Browser support for the W3C Service Worker API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers) currently exists in Firefox, Chrome, and Chrome for Android, with other likely to follow.

= What is the default policy for caching content? =
The plugin will try to always serve fresh content from the Internet. After visiting a post or a page, the content will be cached in the background. In case of an unreliable network or lack of connectivity, the plugin will serve the cached content.

= Can I use the plugin in combination with other plugins using SW =
Since version 0.2.0, you can use this plugin in combination with other using the [WordPress Service Worker Manager library](https://github.com/mozilla/wp-sw-manager/blob/master/README.md).

= Can I configure which content is available for offline reading? =
In a very limited way, yes. You can enable/disable if pages should be precached in such a way they will be available by the user even if they were never visited before.

= Does this plugin modify my theme files? =

Absolutely not -- no files are modified or generated by this plugin.

= When should the theme file options be updated? =

It's best to update the plugin file options when you've added a new file to your theme that you'd like cached.  Files that change or are deleted will be automatically detected and will not create problems within the service worker.

More options will be available with new versions of the plugin.
